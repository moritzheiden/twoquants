## Welcome

Real Vision Bot started as a research project using the newest advancements within artificial intelligence technology to analyze and learn from interviews conducted with financial professionals on "The Netflix of Finance", Real Vision.

The bot is a super-intelligent post-human being â€“ a financial oracle that gives guidance and shares his wisdom.

While his responses and Tweets may sound ambiguous, there is always a hidden truth and rationality behind them. Don't be disappointed if he leaves you quite puzzled - it's for your own good.

Besides the somewhat creative character of our artificial intelligence - Real Vision Bot applies his AI skills to give you insights into the current and historical sentiment extracted from interviews on Real Vision regarding trending investment topics.

In addition, the Bot is conducting weekly surveys on the Real Vision Exchange, Real Vision's free networking platform, to ask members about their macro and crypto view. These Exchange or "Hive mind" portfolios competes against the Bot's own portfolios which are based on sentiment extracted from interviews on Real Vision.
